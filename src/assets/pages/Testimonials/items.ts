      "I was lucky enough to run into Gopa at her pop up at Old Navy and then again at the holiday shopping in downtown Natick. Her cookies are beautiful and taste even better. I was lucky to get to try all that I got before my family got to them and they were gone! The macaroons are the cutest prettiest things. They are so colorful and I have seen many of her different arrangements with them - creative and awesome. They melt in your mouth. I cannot wait to order from her for an event. ",

      "My daughter and I are gluten and dairy sensitive so to find a delicious dessert is not an easy find. Gopa created a Gluten and dairy free Chai cookie and they were AMAZING!! Gopa told us that there may be flour dust in the air so there would be a chance of cross contamination, fortunately we have a sensitivity, not allergy and no reactions other than happy tastebuds!!!",

    testimonial:
      "Not only are the baked goods from Gopastries nice to look at but they are equally delicious. The macaroons were consumed within hours by my family and the Parker House rolls were light, with just the right degree of softness on the inside and slight crust on the outside. Gopa is extraordinarily talented and we look forward to trying more of her creations",

      "I do not have enough superlatives to describe Gopa's baking! Everything was fresh and very tasty. She also baked some unfrosted sugar cookies for a family member who has spent years in the food service industry. He described them as having a delightful flavor with great texture which sounds so simple but is apparently quite rare. I look forward to ordering again very soon!",

The chocolate cupcakes are decadent, macaron's are crispy and fluffy and delightful, and the chai cookies are definitely some of the best cookies I have ever had! Along with everything being tasty, Gopa herself is amazing to work with. I can't recommend Gopastries enough!",

      "Gopa's cookies were absolutely delicious and beautiful! The attention to detail is incredible. The Gingerbread cookies were adorable, the kids loved the decorated sugar cookies (snowmen, Santa hats, Christmas stockings) and the hazelnut cookies were a hit. She also uses real matcha in her cookies so it has the distinct flavor which I loved. Gopa is extremely talented in both design and high quality ingredients to make the perfect cookie. I highly recommend her work and would absolutely buy her cookies again.",

    testimonial:
      "Every year for Christmas Eve, my family has She-Crab soup with Parker House rolls. This year, I saw that GoPastries offered Salted Honey Parker House rolls and wanted to support a local small business. My teenagers stopped to pick up the rolls on their way home and walked in the door raving about how delicious looking and smelling the rolls were. My family was so excited to try the rolls they could not wait until Christmas Eve and tore into them as soon as they sat down. My children are not big bread or roll eaters, but both exclaimed how wonderful these rolls were and that I needed to stop what I was doing and try one right then and there. The rolls melted in my mouth. On Christmas Eve, I like to dip the rolls into the soup, but Gopa's rolls are heavenly, and to dip them would have done a disservice. As a family, we ate 24 rolls in two days, and my kids have asked me to order more. My daughter even thinks that GoPasteries should ONLY sell these rolls because they are just that AMAZING!  If the rest of the items are half as good as the rolls, you better get your orders in early!",

      "The macaroon tree was a delicious and beautiful addition to our holiday table. The tree is made from macaroons and buttercream frosting. It's the perfect way to quench your sweet tooth after a holiday meal. It also makes a great gift or hostess gift. Working with Gopa is easy and straightforward. She's a great communicator and baker!",

    testimonial:
      "I've been looking for the perfect gingerbread cookie for years, and I finally found it! Gopa's gingerbread men are perfect (not too hard, not too soft) and the best-tasting I've ever had (even better than Gingerbread Construction Company)! I am also a bread connoisseur (not really, I just LOVE fresh, quality bread) and her salted honey butter parker house rolls are my new favorite to have with dinner or just alone (and they don't even need butter). I hid a few from my family. Lastly, I bought 8 cinnamon rolls (she gave me 12!) for Christmas morning and my two grown sons ate most of them within minutes of opening gifts. Luckily I grabbed two of them and they did not disappoint. SO, Gopa is the real deal. I will be buying more from her very soon.",

    testimonial:
      "We purchased 20 boxes of mixed cookies and macaroons from Go Pastries to give away as holiday gifts. To say these were a huge hit is an understatement! So many people have asked me for Gopa‚Äôs information because they want to thank her and order more! My only regret is that we didn‚Äôt order more boxes for ourselves. I‚Äôve never eaten a macaroon so delicious in my life. ",
